description: Clean up a completed/merged worktree with protected branch safeguards. Remove worktree; for non-protected branches, delete branch (local+remote) by default if merged/no unique commits; for protected branches, preserve branch. Update tracking when enabled. Stop on dirty/unmerged without approval.

# Worktree Cleanup Agent

## Invocation

This agent is invoked via the Claude Task tool by a skill or command. Do not invoke directly.

## Input Protocol

Read inputs from `<input_json>` (JSON object). If omitted, treat as `{}` (batch mode).

## Purpose

Clean up worktrees by calling `worktree_cleanup.py`. Supports two modes:
1. **Batch mode**: Clean all merged+clean worktrees, report dirty/unmerged
2. **Single branch mode**: Clean a specific branch (with optional force)

Protected branches are resolved from `.sc/shared-settings.yaml` (`git.protected_branches`), with gitflow auto-detection cached there.
Batch cleanup reconciles JSONL tracking before taking actions and operates on tracked worktrees. If tracking is disabled, it falls back to the current `git worktree list` output.

## Execution

Run the cleanup script once with the input JSON:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/worktree_cleanup.py '<input_json>'
```

**Batch mode:** `{}` cleans all merged+clean worktrees and reports dirty/unmerged.

**Single branch mode:** `{"branch": "feature/x"}` cleans a specific branch. Use `{"branch": "feature/x", "require_clean": false}` only with explicit approval.

## Input Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `branch` | string | No | null | Branch to clean (omit for batch mode) |
| `require_clean` | bool | No | true | Set false to force-delete dirty worktree |
| `path` | string | No | auto | Worktree path |
| `merged` | bool | No | auto | Override merge detection |
| `tracking_enabled` | bool | No | true | Update tracking document |
| `cache_protected_branches` | bool | No | true | Cache protected branches to `.sc/shared-settings.yaml` |

## Output Protocol

Wrap the script output in `<output_json>` tags with a fenced JSON block. Do not add prose outside the tags.

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Recoverable |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `WORKTREE.NOT_FOUND` | Worktree path doesn't exist | No |
| `WORKTREE.DIRTY` | Uncommitted changes (single branch mode) | Yes |
| `WORKTREE.UNMERGED` | Branch has unmerged commits | Yes |
| `GIT.ERROR` | Git command failed | No |

## Rules

- **Protected branches**: Never deleted (main, develop, master). Worktree removed, branch preserved.
- **Merged + clean**: Auto-cleaned in batch mode
- **Dirty**: Reported back, requires explicit `require_clean: false` to force
- **Unmerged**: Never auto-deleted. User must merge first or use `--abort` to discard.

## Constraints

- Run batch mode FIRST with `{}` unless a specific branch was requested
- Do NOT force-delete without user confirmation
- Do NOT run manual git commands; use the script only
