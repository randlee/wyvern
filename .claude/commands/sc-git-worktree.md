# /sc-git-worktree command

Use this command to manage worktrees following the repo's layout and tracking rules. You MUST invoke the appropriate subagent via the Task tool; do not run manual git commands in the primary session.

Defaults:
- Repo root: current directory.
- Worktree base: `../wyvern-worktrees/<branch>`.
- Tracking file: `../wyvern-worktrees/worktree-tracking.jsonl` (disable or override if tracking is not used).

## Protected Branches Configuration

Protected branches (main, develop, master) require special handling to prevent accidental deletion. Configure using:

```yaml
git:
  protected_branches:
    - "main"
    - "develop"
    - "master"
```

**Protected Branch Rules:**
- Cleanup/abort operations NEVER delete protected branches (local or remote)
- Protected branches can only be removed from worktrees, never deleted
- Use `--update` to safely pull changes for protected branches in worktrees
- Protected branches are read from `.sc/shared-settings.yaml` (`git.protected_branches`)
- If not configured, protected branches are auto-detected from git-flow and cached to `.sc/shared-settings.yaml`
- **Required**: Operations fail if protected branches cannot be determined

If run with no options or `--help`: print a concise list of options (no git status) and prompt with a numbered choice for list/status, create, cleanup, or abort; then gather required inputs.

## Behavior

## Task Tool Invocation (Required)

Use the Task tool with `<input_json>` and consume `<output_json>` from the subagent response. No manual git commands in the primary session.

### Template

```xml
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">$SUBAGENT</parameter>
<parameter name="description">$DESCRIPTION</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">Run $SUBAGENT with this input:

<input_json>
```json
$INPUT_JSON
```
</input_json>
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

### --list / --status
MUST invoke `sc-worktree-scan` and render its `<output_json>` summary and recommendations.

### --create
MUST invoke `sc-worktree-create` with `branch`, `base`, `purpose`, `owner`, and optional tracking inputs. Render the `<output_json>` summary.

### --update
MUST invoke `sc-worktree-update` for protected branches only. Render conflicts or success from `<output_json>`.

### --cleanup
MUST invoke `sc-worktree-cleanup`. Batch cleanup reconciles JSONL first, captures untracked local worktrees, then cleans tracked worktrees only. Render the `<output_json>` summary.

### --abort
MUST invoke `sc-worktree-abort` and render the `<output_json>` summary.

### --help
Show options and remind about base branches, paths, tracking toggles, and dirty-worktree safeguards. Keep output concise (no tool traces).
