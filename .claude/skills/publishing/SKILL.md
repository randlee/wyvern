description: Coordinate a manifest-driven software release through a named ATM publisher teammate. Use when preparing release preflight, publishing a release, retrying a failed publish channel, or diagnosing release workflow readiness in the current repository.

# Publishing

Use the named `publisher` ATM teammate for production release work. Do not use
an unnamed background agent and do not create version-specific production
publisher identities. The shared release-state policy is
[`ref/release-state-strategy.md`](ref/release-state-strategy.md); read it
before selecting a branch, preflight location, or publish action.

## Start the publisher

1. Verify the required tools before delegation:

   ```bash
   command -v atm && atm --help
   command -v rmux && rmux --help
   ```

2. Confirm the roster has a named `publisher` teammate. Start one when needed;
   its production identity is exactly `publisher` for either runtime:

   ```bash
   rmux claude publisher --team <team-name> --model <claude-model>
   rmux codex publisher --team <team-name> --model <codex-model>
   ```

   The launch must establish `ATM_TEAM=<team-name>` and
   `ATM_IDENTITY=publisher`. Evaluation runs may use a distinct, clearly
   non-production identity.

3. Send a rendered [`preflight.xml.j2`](preflight.xml.j2) or
   [`publish.xml.j2`](publish.xml.j2) assignment through ATM. Require the
   immediate ACK, milestone status, and fenced JSON completion report from
   `publisher`.

## Channel publishers

The named `publisher` teammate coordinates role-specific background channel
workers inside its own session. `release/publish-channel-contracts.toml`
defines their standard role and contract; [`ref/channel-contracts.md`](ref/channel-contracts.md)
defines its operating procedure. Do not launch them as ATM teammates or tmux
panes, and do not duplicate secret names, registry APIs, or account conventions
in a repository manifest.

Before delegation, `publisher` and each channel worker must read the concise
credential facts in [`ref/channel-contracts.md`](ref/channel-contracts.md).
Credentials are already configured; do not ask for them. `Release Preflight`
is authoritative.

- `crates-io-publisher` — crate name/version inquiry and partial crate retry
- `pypi-publisher` — normalized PyPI/TestPyPI inquiry and rehearsal
- `github-release-publisher` — immutable GitHub Release channel
- `homebrew-publisher`, `winget-publisher`, `scoop-publisher` — their matching
  manifest-declared destination only

Ask `publisher` whether `<name>` is available on a registry; it delegates a
role-specific background worker for the read-only inquiry. The response must distinguish
`apparently_available`, `taken`, and `indeterminate`; a lookup never reserves a
name. Publishing remains gated by `publisher` and Release Preflight.

## Durable evaluations

Run the applicable fresh-context evaluation after changing this skill,
`publisher.md`, the manifest helper, or release workflows. The durable cases
are [`evals/publisher-preflight.md`](evals/publisher-preflight.md) and
[`evals/publisher-recovery.md`](evals/publisher-recovery.md). They use
evaluation-only identities and must never create a production tag or publish.
Also run [`evals/channel-name-inquiry.md`](evals/channel-name-inquiry.md) after
changing a background channel-worker contract or registry inquiry helper.

## Operating rules

- Use the assignment's publishing manifest (normally
  `release/publish-artifacts.toml`) and `.github/scripts/release_artifacts.py` as the
  only repository-specific publish surface.
- Use the vendorable `release/publish-channel-contracts.toml` as the single
  shared channel contract and [`ref/channel-contracts.md`](ref/channel-contracts.md)
  for its operating procedure. Preflight obtains public version/name evidence
  for every declared crate and Python distribution before it authorizes
  publication.
- Complete readiness preflight before a `main` merge and final preflight on
  the exact `main` commit before publishing, as the shared policy requires.
- Under explicit publisher assignment, dispatch `release-candidate.yml` to
  establish `release-candidate-vX.Y.Z` from `develop` before creating the
  release branch. Do not create that tag locally. The final gate requires the
  candidate tag to be an ancestor of `main`, not that `main` and `develop`
  still have identical tips.
- Before each preflight, record the candidate-to-release diff and escalate
  non-trivial implementation or dependency changes to the named coordinator.
  Commits added to `develop` after the candidate cut do not delay the release.
- Treat all publish tokens as already-provisioned GitHub Actions secrets. Do
  not ask whether they exist, request them, inspect them, or substitute local
  credentials.
- Permit retry only for failed structured results. For a partial crates.io
  run, preserve the same tag and release ref; the idempotent manifest job skips
  live crates and retries only the missing crate set.
- Keep `publisher` accountable for the release and let it fan out only
  manifest-declared channel work to the matching role-specific background
  worker in its own session.
