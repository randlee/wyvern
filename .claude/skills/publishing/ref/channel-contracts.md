# Publish Channel Contracts

`release/publish-channel-contracts.toml` is the sole channel-contract source.
It defines names, standard secret names, GitHub environments, public endpoints,
and liveness checks. **`release/org-destinations.toml`** defines mandatory
org-wide publish destinations and required channels; see
`ref/org-destinations.md`. This document defines only the operating procedure for
using that contract. Copy both files unchanged when vendoring the publish kit.

## Common rules

- Tokens are GitHub Actions secrets with the names declared in the TOML. Never
  request, inspect, print, or replace one locally.
- Credential facts:
  - `PYPI_API_TOKEN` — Actions `pypi` environment; preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish:
    `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`.
  - `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` — Actions `testpypi` environment; preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish:
    `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`.
  - `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` — repository secret for preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; the publish job runs in the
    Actions `crates-io` environment in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
  - `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` — repository secret; preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish:
    `.github/workflows/homebrew-publish.yml`.
  - `WINGET_GITHUB_TOKEN` — repository secret; preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish:
    `.github/workflows/winget-publish.yml`.
  - `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN` — repository secret; preflight:
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish:
    `.github/workflows/scoop-publish.yml`.
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GitHub-provided Actions token; preflight runs with
    `contents:read` and verifies the release declaration in
    `.github/workflows/release-preflight.yml`; publish uses `contents:write`
    in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- These credentials are already configured. Do not ask whether they exist or
  ask anyone to provide them; run the named preflight workflow and report its
  sanitized result.
- A public lookup is evidence of registry state, not a reservation. Treat a
  timeout, rate limit, unexpected response, or 5xx as `indeterminate`.
- `publisher` may delegate a read-only inquiry to a role-specific background
  worker without a release assignment. Publishing, workflow dispatch, or retry
  still requires the `publisher` assignment and successful preflight evidence.

## crates.io and PyPI inquiry — `crates-io-publisher`, `pypi-publisher`

For a publisher-delegated, read-only candidate-name or candidate-version inquiry, generate
the contract-derived public URLs before calling `curl`:

```bash
python3 .github/scripts/release_artifacts.py public-registry-inquiry-plan \
  --contracts release/publish-channel-contracts.toml \
  --channel crates_io --name example-crate --version 0.1.0
```

For each returned URL, issue a public `curl --silent --show-error --output
/dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' <url>` request. A project `404` is
`apparently_available`; project `200` is `taken`; another status is
`indeterminate`. If a version was supplied, a version `200` is `already_live`,
while version `404` is available for a project that is already taken. A query
does not reserve a name. The helper applies PEP 503 normalization for PyPI and
reports TestPyPI as rehearsal information only.

For a partial crates.io retry, derive the full check plan from the manifest,
retain `already_live` entries, and publish only the missing set in manifest
order. Cargo publishing is permanent; never bump a version merely because a
new crate was missing in an earlier run.

## GitHub Release — `github-release-publisher`

No external secret is needed. The root release workflow must declare
`contents: write`; it owns tag and immutable GitHub Release creation. Never
create or move tags manually.

## Homebrew — `homebrew-publisher`

Use the contract-declared GitHub token liveness check before dispatching the
manifest-declared tap workflow. Destination repository, formulas, assets, and
verification commands come from the manifest. Each `[[channels.homebrew.formulas]]`
entry declares its path, template, class, `binaries`, test fields, and
`release_track`; stable tags select every `stable` entry, while prerelease tags
select only `prerelease` entries. `test_binary` defaults to the first binary.
For vendor compatibility, a legacy single `binary` normalizes to a one-entry
`binaries` list; new manifests must use `binaries`.

## winget — `winget-publisher`

Use the contract-declared GitHub token liveness check before dispatching the
manifest-declared workflow. The manifest owns the package identifier and
installer target.

## Scoop — `scoop-publisher`

Use the contract-declared GitHub token liveness check before dispatching the
manifest-declared workflow. The manifest owns the bucket, manifest path,
template, and installer target.
